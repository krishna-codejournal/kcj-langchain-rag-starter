# README Documentation

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of the LangChain framework for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It focuses on integrating vector database embeddings and showcases several use cases leveraging LangChain's capabilities for efficient information retrieval and generation.

## Features

- **LangChain Framework Integration:** Utilizes LangChain to orchestrate language model workflows and retrieval mechanisms.
- **Vector Database Embedding:** Implements vector-based storage and retrieval using embeddings for semantic search.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval from external knowledge sources with generative models to enhance response accuracy and relevance.
- **Use Cases:** Includes practical examples and scenarios illustrating how LangChain and RAG can be applied to real-world problems.

## Contents

- `src/`: Source code implementing LangChain workflows, vector database setup, and RAG pipelines.
- `examples/`: Sample scripts and notebooks demonstrating use cases.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lang-chain-RAG-repo.git
    cd lang-chain-RAG-repo
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure Vector Database:**
    - Set up your preferred vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma).
    - Update configuration files with your database credentials and settings.

4. **Run Example Use Cases:**
    - Navigate to the `examples/` directory.
    - Execute sample scripts to explore RAG workflows.

## Usage

- **Embedding Documents:** Scripts are provided to embed documents into the vector database for semantic search.
- **Querying with RAG:** Use the provided interfaces to query the database and generate responses using language models.
- **Custom Workflows:** Extend or modify existing workflows to suit your specific use case.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain:** Framework for building language model-powered applications.
- **Vector Databases:** FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma, or other supported backends.
- **Python:** Primary programming language for implementation.
