    "# LangChain PDF Loaders \n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides several PDF loaders to help you extract text and metadata from PDF documents. Below are examples and descriptions of popular loaders:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. PyPDFLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyPDFLoader** uses the `PyPDF2` library to load and parse PDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "loader = PyPDFLoader(\"example.pdf\")\n",
    "documents = loader.load()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros:** Simple, widely used, good for basic text extraction.\n",
    "- **Cons:** May struggle with complex layouts or scanned PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. PyMuPDFLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyMuPDFLoader** leverages the `PyMuPDF` (fitz) library for more advanced PDF parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.document_loaders import PyMuPDFLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "loader = PyMuPDFLoader(\"example.pdf\")\n",
    "documents = loader.load()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros:** Handles images, complex layouts, and can extract metadata.\n",
    "- **Cons:** Slightly heavier dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. UnstructuredPDFLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "**UnstructuredPDFLoader** uses the `unstructured` library for robust document parsing, including scanned PDFs and documents with complex formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredPDFLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "loader = UnstructuredPDFLoader(\"example.pdf\")\n",
    "documents = loader.load()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros:** Best for messy, scanned, or highly formatted PDFs.\n",
    "- **Cons:** Requires additional dependencies and setup.\n",

    "---\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose the loader based on your PDF's complexity and content type.\n",
    "- For best results, test with a sample document before processing large batches.\n",

    "## Common PDF Issues and Fixes\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with PDF loaders in LangChain, you may encounter several common issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encrypted PDFs:**  \n",
    "    - Some PDFs are password-protected.  \n",
    "    - Solution: Ensure you have the password and use loaders that support encrypted PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Corrupted PDFs:**  \n",
    "    - Loaders may fail if a PDF is corrupted.  \n",
    "    - Solution: Try opening the PDF in a viewer to check its integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Layouts:**  \n",
    "    - PDFs with tables, images, or unusual formatting may not extract text cleanly.  \n",
    "    - Solution: Use OCR-based loaders (like UnstructuredPDFLoader) for scanned or complex documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Missing Dependencies:**  \n",
    "    - Required libraries (e.g., PyMuPDF, PyPDF2) may not be installed or up-to-date.  \n",
    "    - Solution: Ensure all dependencies are installed and updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Large Files:**  \n",
    "    - Very large PDFs can be slow or fail to process.  \n",
    "    - Solution: Split large PDFs into smaller sections before loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:**  \n",
    "Use `TokenTextSplitter` from `langchain.text_splitter` to break large text documents into manageable chunks for processing with language models.\n",
