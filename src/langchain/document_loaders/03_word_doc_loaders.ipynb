      "\n",
      "Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create images, text or audio output in response to an input, or ‘prompt’, that we give it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI learns from lots of examples and then uses our prompting, together with what it has learned, to make something new and original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine it as an artist who learns to paint in the style of many famous painters and then creates unique paintings in any style we ask for.\n",
      "\n",
      "This technology is exciting but also challenges us to ask questions such as “what counts as original work when a computer is the one creating it?”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should we have a Generative AI statement?\n",
